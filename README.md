**SOC-Home lab**

 **Objective**

This repository documents the setup of my personal Security Operations Center (SOC) lab as I train toward a Tier-1 SOC Analyst role and prepare for Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1).

The goal is to simulate real-world monitoring, logging, and incident investigation workflows.



 **Why I’m Building This**

I’m currently studying full-time and building hands-on blue team skills.
This lab will be used to:

* Generate and analyze logs
* Practice alert triage
* Investigate suspicious activity
* Write incident reports
* Develop detection thinking

All progress and investigations will be documented here.

 **Lab Plan**

**Environment**

* Windows VM (log generation & attack simulation)
* Linux VM (monitoring/SIEM)

**Tools**

* Virtualbox
* Sysmon
* Wazuh or ELK (planned)
* Wireshark



**Build Progress**

 **Day 1 – Lab Setup Started**

* [ ] Install Virtualbox
* [ ] Create Windows VM
* [ ] Create Linux VM
* [ ] Install Sysmon
* [ ] Generate logs

This section will be updated daily as the lab grows.



 **Goal**

By the end of this project, I will have:

* A working SOC lab
* Multiple investigation reports
* Detection practice
* Documented learning



**Status:** 🟡 In Progress (February 2026)
