# SOC Home Lab – Journey to SOC Analyst Tier 1

I am a recent Information Security & Forensics graduate building hands-on blue team skills through a structured SOC home lab.  
This repository documents my daily progress as I prepare for a SOC Analyst Tier 1 role and Blue Team Level 1 certification.



 **Objective**

Over the next 90 days I am:

- Building a functional SOC lab
- Generating and analyzing logs
- Practicing investigations
- Documenting findings
- Developing real analyst workflow habits

This repository serves as proof of practical skills, consistency, and growth.



 **Lab Environment**

**Virtualization**
- VirtualBox

**Machines**
- Kali Linux (attacker/testing)
- Windows 10 (target system)

This environment will simulate real-world monitoring and detection scenarios.



 **Project Structure**


This repository documents the setup of my personal Security Operations Center (SOC) lab as I train toward a Tier-1 SOC Analyst role and prepare for Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1).

The goal is to simulate real-world monitoring, logging, and incident investigation workflows.

**Tools**

* Virtualbox
* Sysmon
* Wazuh or ELK (planned)
* Wireshark


All progress and investigations will be documented here.



**Progress Log**

Day 1 – Lab Setup
- Installed VirtualBox  
- Created Kali Linux VM  
- Created Windows 10 VM  
- Verified both machines run  
- Captured screenshots  

Next:
- Configure networking  
- Install Sysmon  
- Begin log generation  


 Career Direction

Target Role: **SOC Analyst Tier 1**  
Focus: Blue Team / Security Operations
